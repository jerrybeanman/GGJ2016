# FreyasTemptation

A Windows/Mac/Linux top town game written in C#. The game was created for the Global Game Jam 2016 competition, a 48 hour game making competition where we had to create a game around the theme of "ritual".

In the game, you play as a girl named Freya, who has had a ritual performed on her by her fellow villagers. She is now cursed. If she gets too close to a fellow villager, she will lose all self control and turn into a monster, and then eat them. However, being a sweet girl, you have no intention of hurting the others. You must avoid the villagers to prevent yourself from hurting them, all the while finding other sources of food to satisfy your hunger.

# Tools Used

The game is written in C# using the Unity game engine as our engine of choice.
